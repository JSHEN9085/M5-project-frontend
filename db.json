      "text": "acLazyLoadImage.js is a responsive, performance-focused image lazy loader plugin implemented in jQuery.\nThe plugin automatically replaces the placeholder with the original image when the container is scrolled into view.\nIt also has the ability to handle images loading on multiple screen resolution that detects the user's screen size and serves the right image based on the viewport. How to use it:\n1. Insert images into the following data attributes: data-src: original image data-src-small: image for small screen data-src-big: image for large screen <div class=\"img_lazy\" data-src=\"original.jpg\" data-src-small=\"small.jpg\" data-src-big=\"large.jpg\"></div>\n2. Insert the minified version of the jQuery acLazyLoadImage.js after jQuery. <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-tsQFqpEReu7ZLhBV2VZlAu7zcOV+rXbYlF2cqB8txI/8aZajjp4Bqd+V6D5IgvKT\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script><script src=\"acLazyLoadImage.min.js\"></script>\n3. Call the plugin on the DIV container. That's it. $( document ).ready(function() { $( \".img_lazy\" ).ImgLazyLoad(); });\n4. Specify the breakpoints for the responsive image delivery. $( \".img_lazy\" ).ImgLazyLoad({ mobile: 640, qhd: 1680 });\n5. Specify the top offset the browser starts loading the original image. $( \".img_lazy\" ).ImgLazyLoad({ offset: -150 });\n6. Determine how often the plugin checks the visibility. $( \".img_lazy\" ).ImgLazyLoad({ time: 200 }); This awesome jQuery plugin is developed by Toxdg .

      "text": "We added support to change installation locations . You can Save All your pending changes before you start your update. The update dialog provides you even more details about your update during installation. C# 7.3 is included in Visual Studio version 15.7. We improved solution load time for C# and VB projects. We made numerous updates to F# and its tools , with a focus on performance. We reduced the time to enable IntelliSense for large .NET Core projects by 25%. We made Quick Info improvements and new .NET refactorings like convert for -to- foreach and make private fields readonly . Live Unit Testing works with embedded pdbs and supports projects that use reference assemblies. The Test Explorer has more responsive icons during test runs. C++ developers can use CodeLens for unit testing . We added new rules enforcing items from the C++ Core Guidelines . Debugging large solutions with /Debug:fastlink PDBs is more robust. Python projects support type hints in IntelliSense, and a Run MyPy command has been added to look for typing errors in your code. Conda environments are supported in Python projects. We added a next version of our Python debugger based on the popular open source pydevd debugger. TypeScript 2.8 is included in Visual Studio version 15.7.",

      "title": "How Do You Solve a Problem Like XPages?",
      "text": "How Do You Solve a Problem Like XPages? How Do You Solve a Problem Like XPages? Nov 2, 2018\n(Fair warning: this is a meandering one and I'm basically a wet blanket the whole way through)\nLast week, HCL held the third of their Twitter-based developer Q&As , with this one focusing on XPages and Designer. The majority of the questions (including, admittedly, all of mine) were along the lines of either \"can we get some improvements in the Java/XPages stack?\" or \"is XPages still supported?\". The answer to the latter from HCL, as it would have to be, is that XPages is still alive and \"fully supported\".\nI don't doubt at all that XPages is supported in the sense that it has been for the last couple years: if you as a customer encounter a bug in the platform, support will take your call and will most likely either have a workaround or will get a fix in. This will no doubt happen naturally as time marches on, primarily when a new version of a browser breaks something in the version of Dojo that XPages uses (currently, I believe, a couple notches down the list as 1.9.7). So, that's good, and is better than the worst-case scenario.\nIt's not great , though. Version 10 had essentially no changes for XPages - that makes sense with its \"stanch the bleeding\" market goal, but it continues the history of very little progress. Outside of the forced-for-security-reasons bump to Java 8 in 9.0.1FP8 (which is admittedly nice), the last major addition to XPages was the Bluemix tooling via the Extension Library, which, as far as I can tell, only exists because of the way funding politics works inside IBM. Before that, I'd mark it as the promotion of Bootstrap renderers from Bootstrap4XPages to the main ExtLib just shy of four years ago . Before that, it was... I guess adding the ExtLib to the main product in 9.0, which sort of counts. Before that, it was pretty much the introduction of the extension points and ExtLib in the 8.5.2 era. And sessionAsSigner , I suppose.\nNot to belabor the point too much further, XPages developers are in an uncomfortable spot . For a decade or so now, XPages was the clear \"this is what Domino developers should be doing\" choice, especially in the face of many Domino shops wanting to at the very least get rid of the Notes client. However, though it was modern enough when it was introduced, the stack has missed the boat on a lot of evolution, both in simple terms of its Java EE common ancestor improving on its own and in larger terms of changes in the web development world.\nHad XPages continued under real active development, it could have gradually improved to fit more comfortably in a world of transpiled JavaScript and CSS pre-processors, strict focus on REST APIs, and reactive and streaming APIs. But...\nBut even in that \"active development\" alternate universe, the path would have been awkward. Though XPages has the capacity to be well-structured, Designer and IBM provided no help on this: no model framework, no internal routing, not even an indication that writing Java code was possible in an XPages app until several versions in. The \"MVC\" aspects of its JSF components were beaten down to match the expectations of an NSF container and of LotusScript developers. There's very good reason for that - very few Domino shops were likely to send developers to computer-science boot camps to learn about proper Java EE structure, and the only way XPages was going to work at all was if it started out as \"forms but with partial refresh\".\nAnd, after that first unstructured version, it largely fell prey to the usual problems of enterprise software: IBM isn't in the business of doing things their customers aren't asking for, and the community members asking for, say, a faces-config.xml editor weren't backing those requests up with big licensing checks. I get that, too, I really do. If you spend too much time hypothesizing about and implementing what customers might want, you run the risk of throwing your money down a bottomless hole while your actual customers suffer and leave. So IBM generally swings hard in the other direction, and it's understandable if unfortunate in cases like this, especially when what your customers are strictly asking for is stasis. So What Now?\nOur current situation now is that HCL plans to have a roadmap in Q1 2019 , so I suppose we'll wait and see what they say again. I've been mulling over what I think should be the way forward for XPages and its users, and I don't see any clear good solution.\nThe option that immediately springs to mind is \"add more features to it\": HTTP/2 and WebSockets, newer renderers, an IDE that encourages good development practices, better way to bring in third-party libraries, cleaner JavaScript, and so forth. But what makes this questionable for me is the sheer amount of work, especially since they'd have to start by digging out of an immense amount of technical debt. And this would be very specialized work indeed - the XPages stack is complicated . I'd wager that just the part of the stack that handles ferrying attachments between the browser and a document is more complex than most entire Domino applications by a good margin. While some of the improvements would be handled via the core Domino server team (part of the HTTP upgrades, namely), HCL would likely have to acquire a team of Java developers and have them learn a giant stack of OSGi, JSF, Domino APIs, a couple decades of legacy decisions before even getting going. Possible? Certainly. It's just kind of a hard sell.\nAnother possibility would be open-sourcing the stack and either maintaining it as a project themselves, giving it to OpenNTF, or handing it to an organization like Eclipse, which now holds the reins of Java/Jakarta EE generally. I think that open-sourcing it would have immediate benefits to XPages developers regardless of what else they do with it, but I'm skeptical of how much of a life it would have if it was converted to a community-run project. As it stands, I can only think of a handful of people who a) are aware of XPages and b) would be capable of contributing to its core code. That's not a problem if you are employing people to work on it full-time, but I don't think it has a large enough base to exist on a \"side project\" basis. Attracting new blood would be an uphill battle: even projects like Andmore that have a clear purpose for existing and a contingent of people desperate to keep their workflow can wither on the vine immediately. Outside of Domino developers, XPages would be viewed as \"JSF, except old and restricted to a platform you thought died in the 90s\".\nThe other main thing to do with the stack that doesn't involve killing it, I think, would be pushing it to a state that focuses on REST APIs instead of handling the UI itself, which is something that some XPages devs have been doing already, either by switching to plugins serving up JAX-RS services or via in-NSF controls. This is something that IBM kind-of-sort-of said they were aiming for a couple years ago when they put forward SmartNSF as a good option, but the effective demise of the Extension Library cut off its path into the core, at least for now. Overall, I think that this would make sense. The experience of writing REST services inside an NSF (or in an OSGi plugin) is significantly worse than JAX-RS in a normal Java EE or Spring app, but it provides a clear path for existing NSFs and code to continue being used - more or less - without having to set up a second app server. It may not be the preferred solution for Java in Domino, but it would have the advantage of improving the platform without having to worry anymore about how, say, all the core renderers use tables for layout. For Developers\nFor XPages developers, my long-proffered advice remains the same: learn things that aren't XPages. Whether that means diving head-first into Java EE or Spring , focusing on client-JS development, learning Node, or any other option, you'll likely be well-served by it.\nIt's possible that you could continue to do XPages work or go back to the Notes client indefinitely - XPages will get patches if nothing else, and Nomad breathes undeserved life into LotusScript - but there's no guarantee there. There's no guarantee anywhere else, I suppose, but staying too tied to Domino-specific technology keeps you at immediate risk of a from-above directive to switch away.\nIn short: do not expect a cavalry to ride to your aid. Nov 2, 2018 Ben Langhinrichs It sounds like somebody needs a cookie. Not that I disagree with anything you say, just that a cookie sounds good right around this point in the discussion. That is, if stiff adult drinks are out of the question. While I am not any sort of technical expert, I do like the idea of the REST API internal communication, if only because it sounds like a place where I could dip my toe in and provide a better mousetrap or two. While I work with XPages complexity for the sake of AppsFidelity, it is a bitch and a bear, or perhaps even a bitchy bear. Nov 2, 2018 Russell Maher Very, very sage advice. Thank you for taking the time to put these thoughts out here. I agree with your analysis 100% and am now, for the first time since 1996, looking for a new platform on which to develop applications. The likelihood of XPages \"improving with age\" feels low now. The good news for my company is that we never really pushed the boundaries of core Domino and XPages functionality (a complex execution of that functionality, yes, but still well within very basic core functionality) so we have weathered quite well since migrating our main application to XPages in 2010 but it feels like sometimes we have dodged a bullet (or three) when browsers have updated or issues arose on the Webby World. From what I am seeing now as someone who relies on this technology to deliver an application to paying customers, staying on Domino 10 + HCL feels like playing Russian Roulette and I get to add another bullet about every six months. No matter what, eventually I'll lose. Sadly, there is no obvious path away from Domino as an app dev platform. Every other option is likely to prove more costly to operate in almost every way and more complex to manage although the results will, more than likely, be significantly more future-proofed. The upside of it all? More learning. I always like that! Nov 2, 2018 David Leedy I totally agree. There is a big difference between \"Supported\" (Life Support) and \"Supported\" (Enhancing and making it better). I'm only seeing the bare minimum \"life support\" options. And now having to wait till 2019 reminds of what IBM did last time. They gave us hope and made us wait for a roadmap and then that roadmap was 3 different migration strategies. Nov 3, 2018 Henning Heinz I am not sure if this is a fair statement \" For a decade or so now, XPages was the clear \"this is what Domino developers should be doing\" choice \" IBM XPages technology were the remains of a failed IBM product, put into Domino because component recycling is what has been hip at IBM those days. IN my opinion It never had a great future. I've had a look and did not like it, most of for the reason you count as sacrifice for Lotusscript developers. It is a rough end for believers, some people have invested much and now have to think all over again. This is not IBM's fault alone asOracle has done much harm to the Java Ecosystem, mainly because for Oracle everything has to become a cash cow. It is good to remind people that they should think carefully when moving forward with IBM and I really had a good laugh for the \"undeserved life into LotusScript\". Now it might be cool to run some ancient Notes applications on a mobile device but I would not bet that this is moving forward either. Node.Js has the advantage that is is quite successful product outside of the IBM universe. I have used it but I am still not sure if I would like to develop with Domino as a backend. The greatest thing about IBM XPages was/is its community. I say this although I have never been an active part of it but there are some people that really wanted to make this platform succeed and pushed very hard. Even when I stopped using XPages some years ago it has been energizing and motivating to see others fighting sharing their knowledge and trying to fix things IBM did not want to deliver. I hope that HCL will find a way to move Notes and Domino forward. Post New Comment",

The trailer launch event was a crowd pleaser in itself and looked phenomenal. The entire cast and crew were present at the launch taking the excitement of all the fans present there to the next level.\nThe director of the film, S. Shankar took the opportunity to share a few words and was all praises for Superstar, Rajinikanth . The seasoned actor has millions of fans and enjoys a stardom like no other but he is known to be extremely humble. Having worked with him, director S. Shankar also got a first-hand experience of this. He spoke to the media and revealed what made Rajinikanth such a big superstar. Praising the megastar he said:\nThe biggest strength of the film is Rajini sir. Whatever he does it’s stylish, massy and beautiful. Despite so many years in acting, his performance is still fresh. When we started the shoot, he wasn’t keeping well. When we began in Delhi, it was a planning of 6 months and we didn’t know what to do. Despite being unwell, Rajini sir came to Delhi and shot the scenes. He wore costumes weighing heavy and shot the scenes. Rajini sir was injured during one of the scenes and we wanted to take him to hospital. But he wanted to finish the shot and then go to the hospital. It is this dedication makes him the superstar.\nWe couldn’t agree more1 Rajini sir has delivered terrific performances over the years. The trailer of 2.0 is another proof that everytime he is onscreen, he leaves people awestruck.\nThe film releases on the 25th of November and we can hardly wait! TAGS",

      "text": "Karishma Govil Nov . 3 . 2018 Paneer Bhurji (Image Source: Vidhi Doshi)\nCooking is a skill, really. If a dish is cooked in the perfect way, it could blow a person’s mind. And the right recipe could do exactly that. Today, thanks to Vidhi Doshi a.k.a @RamenHairedGirl , we’ve got you a super simple paneer bhurji recipe that’ll make you forget all about eggs. Here it is! What You’ll Need\n1/2 tsp Dhaniya (coriander) seeds 1/2 tsp jeera (cumin) seeds 1 green Chilli, slit 1 medium onion, finely chopped 1 large or 2 small tomatoes, finely chopped 1/2 tsp garam masala 1 tsp Red chilli powder (adjust according to your taste) 2 pinches turmeric ( haldi ) powder Salt to taste 150 gms fresh paneer (fresh paneer gives a creamy bhurji as opposed to a rubbery one) 1/4 cup finely chopped coriander leaves Here’s How You Can Put It All Together Step 1 Step 1\nPlace the dhaniya and jeera seeds in a bowl and crush them coarsely. Heat the oil in a non-stick pan, add the crushed seeds and saute for 30 secs. Step 2 Step 2\nAdd the slit green chilli and saute again for 30 seconds. Add the onions and let them cook till translucent, about 2-3 minutes on a low-medium flame, making sure they don’t burn. Step 3 Step 3\nAdd the tomatoes, mix well and cook for 3-4 mins, add 2 tbsps of water if the tomatoes are burning. Add the garam masala , turmeric powder, red chilli powder and salt, mix well and cook till the masalas are not raw anymore. You can add 1 tbsp of water here as well if the masalas are burning. Cook for 30 secs. Step 4 Step 4\nCrumble the paneer with your hands very finely and add it to the masala . Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. The key is to get good quality paneer that is fresh and to not cook paneer for too long or else it’ll get rubbery. Step 5 Step 5\nOnce the paneer is heated, adjust the seasoning. Turn off the heat, add coriander immediately and mix well.\nIdeally, you should serve immediately with hot butter pavs or parathas. So, try this out at home and tell us how it turned out in the comments below!\nDon’t forget to follow us at @missmalinilifestyle to never miss a beat! TAGS",

      "text": "Priyanka Parmar Nov . 3 . 2018 Rajnikanth, Akshay Kumar in 2.0\nThe teaser of Superstar Rajinikanth’s 2.0 released back in September and it left everyone awestruck with the visuals and concept. The glimpse of Akshay Kumar as the ultimate villain Crow-Man got us even more excited. The teaser promised us a VFX extravaganza and the trailer seems to have delivered it very well. Your eyes won’t be able to leave the screens as Rajinikanth and Akshay go head-to-head in this sci-fi film. Have a look!\nPretty darn impressive, right?\nAkshay makes for a super-intimidating villain as Crow-Man and Rajinikanth as always has outdone himself in this reloaded version of Chitti . Like the first film, this one also talks about how technology has brought us so far and how it can screw us over too.\nThe film is made with a massive budget of over Rs. 600 Crores and went on floors 2 years ago. Even though it went through multiple delays, the trailer proves that the wait has been worth it.\nAmy Jackson will also be seen 2.0 and she will also be seen shaking a leg with Rajinikanth himself. The movie is directed by S. Shankar and the kick-ass music is composed by none other than A.R. Rahman .\nAt the trailer launch event, director S.Shankar confessed that the audience was his true motivation.\nIt goes beyond superhero vs supervillain, it’s humans against technology and we can’t wait for the film to release on the 25th of November, 2018!

      "text": "Alia Bhatt\nThe belt bag trend is the newer version of the old fanny pack trend. By now, we all know that fanny packs are back in action . But this time around they are not restricted to be worn just at the waist. Nowadays celebrities and bloggers, all over the world, prefer to carry it in a crossbody style too. In fact, some bags are currently specifically designed to be carried this way. This trend has caught on with the B-town too, and we feel that Alia Bhatt is leading the brigade.\nShe first opted to wear them as the earlier version of the fanny pack. But recently she has switched it up to the crossbody way of carrying them. Bags from Dior and Balenciaga that are designed to be carried in this style worked really well with her casual cool ensembles. Also, we observed that her preference for this trend is generally for her travel style. It made perfect sense too because of the compact design, travel essentials like passport, phone, etc. are easy to carry and easy to access too. Here are the five times we have seen her slay this trend recently: ",

      "text": "Karishma Govil Nov . 3 . 2018 Single Girl (Image Courtesy: Shutterstock)\nThe best feeling in the world is to find love and to be in love with someone . But very few and fortunate people find that love in the first try. A lot of other people struggle and have to go through a lot of painful experiences to eventually find the love of their lives. A bad relationship equals a bad breakup. And a bad breakup can really shatter someone to their very core if they were too into the person. To get over the breakup, you must be positive even though it’s hard. You need to tell yourself a few things that’ll reassure your faith in love and help you stay strong. Here they are. 1. Be Strong\nA breakup could mess with your head and in order to stay positive, you need to stay strong. 2. This Too Shall Pass\nThe only thing constant is change. So embrace this phase by telling yourself that this phase will also pass. Nothing is permanent. Woman Crying (Image Courtesy: Shutterstock) 3. Learn From These Mistakes\nEvery experience teaches you something. Instead of sobbing about the breakup, learn from it. 4. Don’t Carry The Baggage\nThe one thing you must learn is to never carry your past relationship baggage to the new one. It isn’t fair to your current partner. And even if you aren’t in a relationship, don’t carry that burden on your shoulders. Just let it go! 5. Someone Better Is Around The Corner\nThere’s always hope of finding someone who is better for you even though it doesn’t seem like it right now. Don’t lose hope. 6. Give Time, Time\nTime is the best teacher. It’ll not only help you learn from experiences but also help you heal. Woman Crying (Image Courtesy: Shutterstock) 7. Let It Out\nIt’s good to talk it out. Talk to someone you trust and let it all out! Bottling up your emotions will never help. In fact, it’s really unhealthy. 8. You Can Do Better\nThis person has hurt you, and clearly, you deserve someone better. So, constantly remind yourself of the standards you need to maintain and don’t settle. 9. It Was Meant To End\nSome things aren’t meant to last. That’s what you need to remind yourself always. Embrace this phase and believe that it was destined and actually happened for the best.\nThere are many ways to get over a relationship and a bad breakup. But according to us, self-healing is the best way to do so. Just stay strong and be positive!\nDon’t forget to follow us at @missmalinilifestyle to never miss a beat! TAGS",

      "text": "Emily Jane Fox, \" Michael Cohen says Trump repeatedly used racist language before his presidency \", Vanity Fair 11/2/2018: After the first few seasons of The Apprentice , Cohen recalled how he and Trump were discussing the reality show and past season winners. The conversation wended its way back to the show’s first season, which ended in a head-to-head between two contestants, Bill Rancic and Kwame Jackson . “Trump was explaining his back-and-forth about not picking Jackson,” an African-American investment manager who had graduated from Harvard Business School. “He said, ‘There’s no way I can let this black f-g win.’” (Jackson told me that he had heard that the president made such a comment. “My response to President Trump is simple and Wakandan,” he said, referring to the fictional African country where Black Panther hails from. “‘Not today, colonizer!’”)\nI puzzled for some time over what word \"f-g\" might be a disguised form of, and eventually decided it must be \"fag\" — though Vanity Fair usually publishes taboo words without disguise , including that one . And even the famously prissy New York Times freely publishes \"fag\" . But does anyone have a better guess?\nI scanned some of the other coverage in the vain hope of seeing an undisguised form of the quotation, but all I found was a few other odd lexical choices. For example, Ken Meyer renders the original \"head-to-head\" as the French borrowing \"tete-a-tete\", which normally means a private conversation rather than a direct conflict (\" Michael Cohen Drops Bombshell: Trump Made Racist Comments, Said Black People ‘Too Stupid’ to Vote For Him \", Mediaite 11/2/2018): The last recollection Cohen had to offer was a moment when he was with Trump for a discussion about the season of The Apprentice that ended in a tete-a-tete between Bill Rancic and Kwame Jackson . “Trump was explaining his back-and-forth about not picking Jackson,” an African-American investment manager who had graduated from Harvard Business School. “He said, ‘There’s no way I can let this black f-g win.’”\nUpdate — I'm convinced by the arguments that f-g here mean \"fucking\". But I was confused because something like f-ing is a more common euphemistic spelling, and also because Vanity Fair is normally fine with printing fucking uneuphemized, e.g. in this 10/2/2018 article : Last month, Osbourne gave a scorching interview about the gig to Howard Stern, responding to a question about why she did not participate in the show’s audition segments by saying, “Oh fuck, I don’t have to have those kids singing in my face. Those little shits. They all suck. It is like, ‘Hey, is this fucking karaoke or what?’” As for the show’s creator, Simon Cowell? Osbourne said he’s a “pain in the arse” who will stop at nothing to get his “fucking fat face on TV.” Cowell was not particularly bothered .",

      "title": "DotPeek Tool: A .NET Decompiler",
      "text": "Watch → Introduction\nThe dotPeek decompiler tool was initially introduced by Microsoft. It's a free-of-charge, standalone tool-based decompiler for any .NET assemblies. It converts .NET assemblies into equivalent C# code and optionally shows the underlying IL code. A dotPeek application can decompile different kinds of assembly files, such as Libraries (.dll), Executable files (.exe), Windows 8 metadata files (.winmd), Archives (.zip), NuGet packages (.nupkg), and Microsoft Visual Studio Extensions packages (.vsix).\nDevelopers can use dotPeek to decompile .NET assemblies based on .NET Framework 1.0 to 4.5 into the equivalent C# code. Features of .NET Decompiler Following is the list of features developers can explore. View Source Code if Available\nDotPeek can generate PDB files. Decompiled code generated by dotPeek can be used to match an assembly to its source code. This tool allows developers to download code from a remote server location, as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Navigation and decompiler options Show or Hide Compiler-generated Code\nAs a developer, we may want to show or hide the compiler-generated code created by this .NET decompiler. We may choose to show certain compiler transformations, thus making a code structure that dotPeek displays. This feature helps to see how the compiler deals with lambdas, closures, and auto-properties, among other things. Explore Running Processes\nThe Process Explorer window of the tool shows the list of all currently running processes. A developer can explore these modules and decompile all the .NET assemblies. A developer can choose to show or hide native processes and modules, or turn on process hierarchy view. You also can filter the list to find a module or process that you're looking for (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Process Explorer View IL Code in a Separate View\nA developer can navigate to IL code from any point of decompiled C# code. That feature is required to dive deeper inside source code. The dotPeek tool provides an easy way to show IL code in a separate tool window that is synchronized with the main code viewer. View IL Code as Comments to Decompiled C#\nA developer also can opt to show IL code as comments to decompiled C# code. DotPeek can display IL code both for decompiled code and for source code reproduced from symbol files. Preferred Color Theme\nDotPeek supports a number of color themes, such as the Visual Studio editor. Developers can select a Blue or Dark theme, or choose to synchronize your color scheme preference with Visual Studio settings. How to Use Symbols\nFrom dotPeek, you can find all usages of a symbol (such as a method or property) across all loaded assemblies. The usages will be displayed in the Find Results tool window where you can group them, navigate between them, and open in the code view area.\nThere's also Find Usages Advanced , which is a more detailed version of Find Usages that helps you fine-tune search criteria by limiting the scope of search and other details. Highlight Usages in a Code Viewer\nDotPeek automatically highlights all visible usages of the symbol under a caret, very similarly to how recent versions of Visual Studio do it. This helps improve the readability of decompiled code. Jump to Any Code\nDotPeek provides two features to quickly jump to specific code: Go to Symbol: Helps navigate to a specific symbol declaration, which could be a type, method, field, or property. Go to Everything: Allows searching for an assembly, namespace, type, member, or a recently opened file. Bookmarking\nTo go back to specific lines of decompiled code later, feel free to set bookmarks.\nYou can create up to 10 numbered bookmarks, and unlimited unnumbered bookmarks. The full list of bookmarked locations is displayed in a single pop-up window. Navigate\nDotPeek supports Navigate contextually and by class hierarchies. Go to Declaration takes you from a usage of any symbol to its declaration. Go to Implementation helps navigate to end implementations of types and type members, bypassing intermediate inheritance steps in the inheritance chain. Explore Inheritance Chains\nDotPeek will show you all types that are inherited from the selected type, as well as types that it inherits themselves. Manage Assembly Lists\nA developer can work with different assembly lists, depending on context. You can save and re-open assembly lists, and clear the current list if you no longer need it. Explore Assembly Contents\nThe Assembly Explorer shows what kind of references, resources, and code a particular assembly has, all the way from namespaces to type members. Explore Assembly Metadata\nDotPeek helps you explore assembly metadata and dig through all items (tables, blobs, strings, and so forth) inside it. Under the Metadata node, you can explore values of blob items, PE file headers, and usages of metadata table items. Conclusion\nI hope this article about dotPeek has given you basic understanding of its usage. To know more, visit this URL. Related Articles",

      "text": "Tweet\nI'm pleased to announce the new GNOME Translation Editor Release. This is the new release of the well known Gtranslator . I talked about the Gtranslator Ressurection some time ago and this is the result:\nThis new release isn't yet in flathub, but I'm working on it so we'll have a flatpak version really soon. Meantime you can test using the gnome nightly flatpak repo. New release 3.30.0\nThis release doesn't add new functionality. The main change is in the code, and in the interface.\nWe've removed the toolbar and move the main useful buttons to the headerbar. We've also removed the statusbar and replaced it with a new widget that shows the document translation progress.\nThe plugin system and the dockable window system has been removed to simplify the code and make the project more maintenable. The only plugin that is maintained for now is the translation memory, that's now integrated. I'm planning to migrate other useful plugins, but that's for the future.\nOther minor changes that we've made are in the message table, we've removed some columns and now we only show two, the original message and the translated one and we use colors and text styles to show fuzzy status and untranslated.\nThe main work is a full code modernization, now we use meson to build, we've flatpak integration and this simplify the development because gtranslator know works by default in Gnome Builder without the need to install development dependencies.\nThere's others minor changes like the new look when you open the app without any file:\nOr the new language selector that autofill all the profile fields using the language:\nAnd for sure we've tried to fix most important bugs:",

      "text": "The 2018 Hour of Code Season Revs Up Written by Sue Gee Friday, 02 November 2018\nA brand new Minecraft activity from Code.org and Microsoft heads the bill for the sixth iteration of the Hour of Code - which runs from December 3-9, 2018. There are already over 40 thousand registered events and there are incentives for classrooms in the US to sign up to be awarded a set of robots or physical computing kits.\nThe Hour of Code site has been refreshed in preparation for this year's visitation. It boasts over 150 new tutorials, along with favorites from previous years. and better still makes it easier to find what you need. You can filter by grade, experience level (Beginner/ Comfortable), and classroom hardware, (Computers/Android/iPad/iPhone; Poor or no internet/No computers or devices). Every activity on HourOfCode.com has been tested by a teacher committee and they are listed in a teacher-recommended order.\nTeachers can find activities designed to reinforce math, language arts, science, social studies, and art. And of course there are activities introducing coding itself, such as App Lab - see Hour of Code 2017 Introduces App Lab - in which you create your own app in JavaScript using blocks or text. There are plenty of activities that use Scratch, Python and JavaScript and for pre-readers there's Kodable.\nThe new Minecraft activity, Voyage Aquatic, takes learners on an adventure to find treasure and solve puzzles with coding.\nFor this year’s Minecraft Hour of Code, Minecraft teamed up with four YouTube creators–AmyLee33, Netty Plays, iBallisticSquid, and Tomohawk. These creative YouTubers guide participants through 12 unique challenges through caves, ruins, and underwater reefs to solve puzzles and learn coding concepts such as loops and conditionals, two fundamental concepts in computer science. Voyage Aquatic encourages students to think creatively, try different coding solutions, and apply what they learn in this mysterious underwater world. The tutorial also includes a ‘free play’ level for participants to apply what they learn in the prior puzzles and use coding to build imaginative underwater creations.\nThere's also a very special new Code.org tutorial which is still under wraps. Stay tuned and we'll reveal it in due course.",

      "title": "Don't Neglect Mobile App Security",
      "text": "Don't Neglect Mobile App Security Friday, 02 November 2018 As people become increasingly reliant on their smartphones and other mobile devices, it’s clear that mobile app development brings some fantastic opportunities to developers. It’s also crucial to develop your mobile apps with the importance of security at the forefront of your mind at all times. Unsecured mobile apps provide ample opportunity for cybercriminals to conduct illicit activities and steal sensitive information. Consider that in many mobile apps, people input a wealth of information about themselves, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details. One serious security breach can cause people to lose trust in your app, and a great idea can turn into a personal nightmare. Traditional information security practices, such as anti-virus software and web application firewalls, fail to protect mobile apps and are only used within enterprises. The information security industry is having to evolve—this blog on information security highlights the latest news, insights, and innovations in cybersecurity, some of which you may find useful. Additionally, here are five excellent data security resources you should know about when to help protect your apps as you develop them. 1. Upwork Tips for Better Mobile Application Security Upwork’s excellent mobile app security resource highlights eight really good tips, including prioritizing security from day one of development. Too often security becomes an afterthought, and this is where issues can start to creep in. Best practices within this tip include encrypting application code, attempting to balance security with performance and user experience, and not relying on app store approval to verify watertight security. From this single tip alone, developers get some excellent ideas, so check out the rest of the seven tips in the article for more best practices on protecting your apps. 2. Techtarget's Guide to Mobile Application Vulnerabilities Techtarget does a stellar job of explaining the most common sources of mobile application vulnerabilities. While it’s probably clear in your mind by now that security is crucial, it’s equally as useful to know where the main vulnerabilities in mobile apps arise. Techtarget’s round-up of mobile app vulnerabilities covers issues such as storing application data as plain text, a lack of encryption, and data leaking from syncing with the cloud. 3. Testbytes 8 Important Steps To Secure Your Mobile App This resource by testbytes is targeted towards developers and can be useful as a checklist or mini-guide to securing your mobile apps as you develop them and post-development. The first step is to secure the code, which you can do by encrypting your code, using vulnerability scanners, and making it easy to port between devices and OS. Another useful tip relates to protecting application data. The resource recommends creating encrypted containers for secure data storage. Other helpful recommendations include using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for identification and authorization. 4. IBM Secure Mobile Application Development This Youtube video features a talk by Tom Mulvehill, Senior Product Manager on the Application Security Product Management team at IBM Security. Tom speaks with expertise and insight on mobile app security, and it’s interesting to listen to him covering several topics within the twenty-minute video duration. Tom talks about how mobile application security risks are growing, how mobile app security differs from web-based app security, and how development teams may introduce security risks into applications. There’s also a useful discussion on addressing mobile app security risks early in the development cycle. Particularly if you develop mobile apps for an enterprise, the earlier you address vulnerabilities, the easier you can keep up with the fast-paced nature of modern development teams that emphasize agility. 5. TechRepublic How To Build A Secure Mobile App There are several articles of this nature online, and some of the points overlap. However, TechRepublic’s version contains some additional useful insights. A particularly important point raised in this resource is the tip that advises developers not to rely on the safety of third-party dependencies. Developers often use freely available open-source components, such as libraries and frameworks because they provide ready-made functionality to their apps. It’s important to be diligent about the third party components that make it into your app. Make sure you trust your dependencies. Other helpful tips in this resource include thinking like an attacker as you are writing your code, which helps you to get into the mindset of not overlooking potential vulnerabilities. Conclusion That wraps up this list of five security resources for protecting your mobile apps. By using the knowledge gleaned from at least some of these resources, you’ll be much better placed to build your future mobile apps to be as secure as you can make them. In this way, you won’t waste your developing talents and excellent app ideas on creating a really good app that suffers a serious security breach due to easily preventable vulnerabilities.",

      "title": "DeOldify - Auto Colorization",
      "text": "Written by David Conrad Saturday, 03 November 2018\nYes it's a neural network and it colors old black-and-white shots to make them look good - to deoldify them. What is amazing about this particular effort is not just that it seems to work well, but it's an amateur (in the best sense of the word) effort.\nYou don't need to be an academic or have the support of a big company to get into AI. All you need is know how and the application of a lot of effort. Jason Antic, who describes himself as: Software guy, currently digging deep into GANs to do some cool photo colorization and restoration!\nhas been doing the sort of work that usually needs a team of people. His only help seems to be a 1080TI GPU, and even then it takes two or three days to train a new model. The description of the design of the neural network for his DeOldify project is a bit vague, but it seems to be a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) with lots of customization. A lot of the fun in this project seems to come from finding out what really works.\nBefore you get too critical of the results, you need to keep in mind that there is no human intervention in this process. It's all up to the neural network and what is more there is no right answer in the sense that for these old photos we really don't know what color anything actually was, only what sorts of colors objects of particular types are. This is presumably what the neural network is learning and it is difficult. OK, the fairy's wing color has bled into the surroundings - but what color should a fairy be?\nThere are lots of examples available on GitHub and it is freely admitted that these are some of the best results. That is the output of the network is being cherry picked. Is this so bad? In many areas of AI research there is a sneaking suspicion that researchers are making it seem their their network is doing better than it really is by only showing the successes. In this case this isn't a problem. This is great - but notice the red hand. What caused the neural network to see the hand as something that wasn't a hand - a purse perhaps?\nThe object of the exercise is to create good looking photos. Photos that pass the human \"looks good\" test. If some don't then perhaps that's just the way it is and we can try again. It is amazing that a neural network can do this job at all and the errors are instructive.\nAt the moment it seems that the model loves to color clothes blue. Perhaps one reason is that it has been trained on panchromatic (colors show with their true brightness) black and white images and the oldie images are orthochromatic (red shows blacker than blue of the same brightness).\nHere is one of my favourites:\nAnd for the future the aim is to not just colorize but to enhance:\nYou can download the code, which has an MIT licence, and get started on your own colorizations, but you will have to train the network yourself. It is promised that the coefficients of the model will be published at some time in the future, but for the moment you can't just play without doing some work.\nThe whole question of releasing the coefficients of the model is a difficult one give the recent case of the painting generated by a GAN that sold for nearly half a million. The network was borrowed from another programmer and then simply used to make money and repuation.\nLet's not end on a sour note. You can do worthwhile AI without a team and with just a good GPU. Without open source this would be much more difficult. More Information",

      "title": "Capability and Suitability",
      "text": "Capability and Suitability 03 Nov 2018\nGary Bernhardt has a fantastic talk on Capability vs Suitability , where he separates advances in software engineering into two buckets: Capability: The ability to do new things! Suitability: The ability to do things well.\nCapability is progressive and daring, while suitability is conservative and boring. Capability wants to create entirely new things, while suitability wants to refine existing things.\nThis post is going to explore a metaphor with bicycles, specifically bike tires, while we think about capability and suitability. When you get a bike, you have so many options. Tire size is one of them. You can opt for a super narrow road tire – a mere 19mm in width! Or, on the other end of the scale, you can opt for a truly fat tire at around 5” in width. What’s the difference?\nNarrower tires are less capable – there is less terrain you can cover on a narrow tire. However, they’re more suitable for the terrain they can cover – a 19mm tire will be significantly lighter and faster thana 5” tire. A good 19mm tire weighs around 200g, while a 5” tire might weigh 1,800g each. Lugging around an extra 7lbs of rubber takes a lot of energy! Additionally, all that rubber is going to have a lot of rolling resistance – it’ll be harder to push across the ground on smooth surfaces where the 19mm tire excels.\nSo, most cyclists don’t use fat tire bikes. But they also don’t use 19mm skinny tires. Most road cyclists have moved up to 25 or 28mm tires. While the 19mm tires work fantastically on a perfectly smooth surface, they start suffering when the road gets bumpy. All the bumps and rough surfaces call for a slightly more capable tire. The wider tires can run lower air pressure, which lets them float over bumps rather than being bumped up and down.\nSo, we have two competing forces in bike tires: The speed and comfort on the terrain you ride most frequently The speed and comfort on the worst terrain you encounter regularly\nYou want enough capability to handle the latter, while a tire that’s suitable for the former.\nIn computer programming, we tend to reach for the most capable thing we can get our hands on. Dynamically typed, impure, and Turing complete programming languages like Ruby, JavaScript, and Python are immensely popular. Statically typed languages are often seen as stifling, and pure languages even more so. There simply aren’t many languages that are Turing incomplete, that’s how little we like them!\nYet, these extra gains in capability are often unnecessary. There’s very little code that’s difficult to statically type with a reasonable type system. Impurity seems convenient, until you realize that you need to look at every single method call to see why the code that renders an HTML page is making an N+1 query and ruining performance. Indeed, even Turing completeness is overrated – a Turing incomplete language permits dramatically more optimizations and static analysis for bug prevention, and very few programs actually require Turing completeness.\nIn this sense, programmers are like cyclists that pick up the 5” tire fat bikes and then wonder why they’re moving so slow. They may ride in the snow or deep sand once or twice a year, and they stick with the 5” tire for that reason alone. Programmers that are willing to give up the capability they don’t need in order to purchase suitability they could use tend to go faster, as you might expect. Folks that learn Haskell and become sufficiently familiar with purely functional and statically typed programming tend to take those practices with them, even in impure or dynamically typed languages.\nIt is easier to understand what you did when you limit what you can do.\nMy blog is hosted on GitHub .

      "text": "An update to \" '100% grated parmesan cheese' \" (9/5/2017): In which the court explains that it can blow off the affidavit of Anne Curzan and Ezra Keshet of the University of Michigan that only one interpretation of the phrase “100% grated Parmesan cheese” is plausible in context, and the affidavit of Kyle Johnson of UM-Amherst that the phrase has only one semantically and pragmatically salient interpretation, because “a reasonable consumer -— the touchstone for analysis under the consumer fraud statutes -— does not approach or interpret language in the manner of a linguistics professor.” Aargh. The new decision has been covered by Rebecca Tushnet at the 43(B) blog (\" Post-parmesan: 100% grated parmesan still doesn't have to be 100% grated parmesan, court reiterates \", 11/2/2018). (The affidavits — indeed, the names of the experts — don’t appear in the decision or in Rebecca’s writeup, but I pulled them off Pacer.)\nThe new opinion is here .\nRebecca Tushnet's post about the earlier opinion is \" '100% grated parmesan cheese' doesn't have to be all cheese, court rules \" (8/30/2017), and the decision in the 2017 case is here .\nPACER is the electronic public access system for the U.S. Federal District and Bankruptcy Courts. Much of the content of PACER is replicated for free at courtlistener.com , which recapitulates some of the content of PACER via RECAP (\"PACER\" backwards — \"turning Pacer around since 2009\"), in particular for this case here . (Though I did not find the linguists' affadavits there yet…)\nAs Wikipedia explains , PACER has been criticized for being technically out of date and hard to use, and for demanding fees for records that are in the public domain . In reaction, non-profit projects have begun to make such documents available online for free.\nA larger selection of Judge Feinerman's 11/1/2018 opinion is worth citing, since after asserting that \"a reasonable consumer … does not approach or interpret language in the manner of a linguistics professor\", he also dismisses a survey showing that \"the 'vast majority' of consumers believe that '100% Grated Parmesan Cheese' means that the product contains only cheese\", since \"it is 'well settled' that a court, on its own, may 'determine as a matter of law' that 'an allegedly deceptive advertisement would not have misled a reasonable consumer'\". In other words, apparently, the only \"reasonable consumer\" is a Federal District Court judge, aka himself: As for applying the standard, the court’s earlier opinion held that “the description ‘100% Grated Parmesan Cheese’ is ambiguous,” reasoning that although “‘100% Grated Parmesan Cheese’ might be interpreted as saying that the product is 100% cheese and nothing else, it also might be an assertion that 100% of the cheese is parmesan cheese, or that the parmesan cheese is 100% grated.” Id. at 923. In challenging that conclusion, Plaintiffs cite two reports from linguistics professors opining that the phrase “100% Grated Parmesan Cheese” conveys only the message that the products consist entirely of cheese. Doc. 255 at 7-8. The linguists do not advance Plaintiffs’ cause. As an initial matter, a reasonable consumer—the touchstone for analysis under the consumer fraud statutes—does not approach or interpret language in the manner of a linguistics professor. See Rugg v. Johnson & Johnson, 2018 WL 3023493, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 18, 2018) (noting that a “reasonable consumer need not be exceptionally acute and sophisticated,” and that “the reasonable consumer test focuses on the perspective of ordinary minds”) (internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, the reports do not indicate that the professors examined the phrase “100% Grated Parmesan Cheese” in the context of shelf-stable, unrefrigerated containers of cheese. As the court explained, that context is important given that the “products are packaged and shelfstable at room temperature, a quality that reasonable consumers know is not enjoyed by pure cheese,” and that “reasonable consumers are well aware that pure dairy products spoil, grow blue, green, or black fuzz, or otherwise become inedible if left unrefrigerated for an extended period of time.” 275 F. Supp. 3d at 923. Even assuming (incorrectly) that reasonable consumers view language through the same lens as linguistics professors, because the linguists did not take account of that context, their opinions are valueless in deciding whether “100% Grated Parmesan Cheese” is ambiguous. Plaintiffs also cite consumer surveys purporting to show that the “vast majority” of consumers believe that “100% Grated Parmesan Cheese” means that the product contains only cheese. Doc. 255 at 7-9. Those surveys are valueless as well. As the Seventh Circuit has held, it is “well settled” that a court, on its own, may “determine as a matter of law” that “an allegedly deceptive advertisement would not have misled a reasonable consumer.” Fink v. Time Warner Cable, 714 F.3d 739, 741 (7th Cir. 2013). The Seventh Circuit has also recognized that “context is crucial” in that, “under certain circumstances, the presence of a disclaimer or similar clarifying language may defeat a claim of deception.” Ibid. Accordingly, consumer surveys do not assist the analysis where, as here, the court can determine as a matter of law that the challenged statement is ambiguous standing alone and particularly given its context. See Goldman v. Bayer AG, 2017 WL 3168525, at *10 (N.D. Cal. July 26, 2017) (denying leave to amend after dismissing statutory consumer fraud claims, even though the plaintiff wished to “arrange for consumer surveys to be conducted,” because surveys would not assist the plaintiff in plausibly “alleg[ing] that he was deceived by information that is plainly accurate”); cf. Groupe SEB USA, Inc. v. Euro-Pro Operating LLC, 774 F.3d 192, 201 (3d Cir. 2014) (in a Lanham Act suit, noting that “words may be used plainly enough and carry baseline meanings such that consumer survey evidence is irrelevant”). Moreover, it bears mention that the surveys find that some consumers do not believe that the products are 100% cheese; the disagreement between those consumers and those who do believe that the products are 100% cheese supports, rather than refutes, the notion that the label is ambiguous.\nUpdate — According to Document #255 in the Pacer collection for this case (free copy here) , Consumer surveys are the gold standard for determining the advertising message conveyed to a reasonable consumer. See Suchanek , 764 F.3d at 753; see also Kraft , 970 F.2d at 318 (“The most convincing extrinsic evidence is a survey of what consumers thought upon reading the advertisement in question . . . .”). Based on a consumer survey conducted in this litigation, over 85% of purchasers of the Products understand the labels to mean the Products are 100% cheese and fully grated. See ECF No. 225 ¶¶3, 29; ECF No. 226 ¶¶3, 17; ECF No. 227 ¶¶3, 24; ECF No. 228 ¶¶3, 24; and ECF No. 229 ¶¶3, 25. This percentage greatly exceeds the 10–20% standard generally used in determining whether an advertising message misleads a reasonable consumer. See In re Telebrands Corp. , 140 F.T.C. 278, 291 (2005) (10.5% to 17.3% “was sufficient to conclude that the challenged claims were communicated”), aff’d , 457 F.3d 354 (4th Cir. 2006); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. FTC , 481 F.2d 246, 249 (6th Cir. 1973) (court unwilling to “overturn the deception findings of the Commission if the ad thus misled 15% (or 10%) of the buying public”); In re Novartis Corp. , 127 F.T.C. 580, 685 (1999), aff’d , 223 F.3d 783 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (30-45% is “more than a significant minority”).\nThe judge's reasoning for dismissing the survey results as \"valueless\" seems to be \"because I can\", though perhaps some readers can elucidate further.\nUpdate #2 — Thanks to Jonathan Weinberg , the linguists' affidavits can be found here and here .",

      "text": "3 November, 2018 Dvorak two years after\nIn November 2016, I switched from QWERTY to Dvorak. The past year , the change wasn’t noticeable yet, so I was hoping this year would.\nThis is the completely unscientific test I run: I visit TypeRacer and record races – I’m going to settle at 20 from now on. The texts aren’t the same from year to year, I just trust the random nature of TypeRacer to give me different kind of them: short, large, with tons of punctuation, with very few breaks, and so on.\nIt looks like I’ve already surpassed my previous baseline after two years using Dvorak – both in terms of speed and accuracy. I had been using QWERTY for about 15 years before switching, so that’s impressive. I guess I’m able to introduce bugs in my code faster!\nIn a more qualitative note, 2018 has been a year of consolidation. Unlike in 2017, I haven’t changed my input devices and my keyboard configuration has remained the same – that has probably helped my muscle memory to develop faster. I still don’t have a steady rhythm and there are some characters I struggle to type. The accuracy results are more meaningful to me than the speed, as that speaks about my finger health long-term, which was the main reason I was interested to give Dvorak a try. Like this:",

      "text": "The Trouble with Typed Errors 03 Nov 2018\nYou, like me, program in either Haskell, or Scala, or F#, or Elm, or PureScript, and you don’t like runtime errors. They’re awful and nasty! You have to debug them, and they’re not represented in the types. Instead, we like to use Either (or something isomorphic) to represent stuff that might fail: data Either l r = Left l | Right r\nEither has a Monad instance, so you can short-circuit an Either l r computation with an l value, or bind it to a function on the r value.\nSo, we take our unsafe, runtime failure functions: head :: [ a ] -> a lookup :: k -> Map k v -> v parse :: String -> Integer\nand we use informative error types to represent their possible failures: data HeadError = ListWasEmpty head :: [ a ] -> Either HeadError a data LookupError = KeyWasNotPresent lookup :: k -> Map k v -> Either LookupError v data ParseError = UnexpectedChar Char String | RanOutOfInput parse :: String -> Either ParseError Integer\nExcept, we don’t really use types like HeadError or LookupError . There’s only one way that head or lookup could fail. So we just use Maybe instead. Maybe a is just like using Either () a – there’s only one possible Left () value, and there’s only one possible Nothing value. (If you’re unconvinced, write newtype Maybe a = Maybe (Either () a) , derive all the relevant instances, and try and detect a difference between this Maybe and the stock one).\nBut, Maybe isn’t great – we’ve lost information! Suppose we have some computation: foo :: String -> Maybe Integer foo str = do c <- head str r <- lookup str strMap eitherToMaybe ( parse ( c : r ))\nNow, we try it on some input, and it gives us Nothing back. Which step failed? We actually can’t know that! All we can know is that something failed.\nSo, let’s try using Either to get more information on what failed. Can we just write this? foo :: String -> Either ??? Integer foo str = do c <- head str r <- lookup str strMap parse ( c : r )\nUnfortunately, this gives us a type error. We can see why by looking at the type of >>= : ( >>= ) :: ( Monad m ) => m a -> ( a -> m b ) -> m b\nThe type variable m must be an instance of Monad , and the type m must be exactly the same for the value on the left and the function on the right. Either LookupError and Either ParseError are not the same type, and so this does not type check.\nInstead, we need some way of accumulating these possible errors. We’ll introduce a utility function mapLeft that helps us: mapLeft :: ( l -> l' ) -> Either l r -> Either l' r mapLeft f ( Left l ) = Left ( f l ) mapLeft _ r = r\nNow, we can combine these error types: foo :: String -> Either ( Either HeadError ( Either LookupError ParseError )) Integer foo str = do c <- mapLeft Left ( head str ) r <- mapLeft ( Right . Left ) ( lookup str strMap ) mapLeft ( Right . Right ) ( parse ( c : r ))\nThere! Now we can know exactly how and why the computation failed. Unfortunately, that type is a bit of a monster. It’s verbose and all the mapLeft boilerplate is annoying.\nAt this point, most application developers will create a “application error” type, and they’ll just shove everything that can go wrong into it. data AllErrorsEver = AllParseError ParseError | AllLookupError LookupError | AllHeadError HeadError | AllWhateverError WhateverError | FileNotFound FileNotFoundError | etc ...\nNow, this slightly cleans up the code: foo :: String -> Either AllErrorsEver Integer foo str = do c <- mapLeft AllHeadError ( head str ) r <- mapLeft AllLookupError ( lookup str strMap ) mapLeft AllParseError ( parse ( c : r ))\nHowever, there’s a pretty major problem with this code. foo is claiming that it can “throw” all kinds of errors – it’s being honest about parse errors, lookup errors, and head erors, but it’s also claiming that it will throw if files aren’t found, “whatever” happens, and etc . There’s no way that a call to foo will result in FileNotFound , because foo can’t even do IO ! It’s absurd. The type is too large! And I have written about keeping your types small and how wonderful it can be for getting rid of bugs.\nSuppose we want to handle foo ’s error. We call the function, and then write a case expression like good Haskellers: case foo \"hello world\" of Right val -> pure val Left err -> case err of AllParseError parseError -> handleParseError parseError AllLookupError lookupErr -> handleLookupError AllHeadError headErr -> handleHeadError _ -> error \"impossible?!?!?!\"\nUnfortunately, this code is brittle to refactoring! We’ve claimed to handle all errors, but we’re really not handling many of them. We currently “know” that these are the only errors that can happen, but there’s no compiler guarantee that this is the case. Someone might later modify foo to throw another error, and this case expression will break. Any case expression that evaluates any result from foo will need to be updated.\nThe error type is too big, and so we introduce the possibility of mishandling it. There’s another problem. Let’s suppose we know how to handle a case or two of the error, but we must pass the rest of the error cases upstream: bar :: String -> Either AllErrorsEver Integer bar str = case foo str of Right val -> Right val Left err -> case err of AllParseError pe -> Right ( handleParseError pe ) _ -> Left err\nWe know that AllParseError has been handled by bar , because – just look at it! However, the compiler has no idea. Whenever we inspect the error content of bar , we must either a) “handle” an error case that has already been handled, perhaps dubiously, or b) ignore the error, and desperately hope that no underlying code ever ends up throwing the error.\nAre we done with the probles on this approach? No! There’s no guarantee that I throw the right error! head :: [ a ] -> Either AllErrorsEver a head ( x : xs ) = Right x head [] = Left ( AllLookupError KeyWasNotPresent )\nThis code typechecks, but it’s wrong , because LookupError is only supposed to be thrown by lookup ! It’s obvious in this case, but in larger functions and codebases, it won’t be so clear. Monolithic error types are bad\nSo, having a monolithic error type has a ton of problems. I’m going to make a claim here:\nAll error types should have a single constructor\nThat is, no sum types for errors. How can we handle this?\nLet’s maybe see if we can make Either any nicer to use. We’ll define a few helpers: type ( + ) = Either infixr + 5 l :: l -> Either l r l = Left r :: r -> Either l r r = Right\nNow, let’s refactor that uglier Either code with these new helpers: foo :: String -> Either ( HeadError + LookupError + ParseError ) Integer foo str = do c <- mapLeft l ( head str ) r <- mapLeft ( r . l ) ( lookup str strMap ) mapLeft ( r . r ) ( parse ( c : r ))\nWell, the syntax is nicer. We can case over the nested Either in the error branch to eliminate single error cases. It’s easier to ensure we don’t claim to throw errors we don’t – after all, GHC will correctly infer the type of foo , and if GHC infers a type variable for any + , then we can assume that we’re not using that error slot, and can delete it.\nUnfortuntaly, there’s still the mapLeft boilerplate. And expressions which you’d really want to be equal, aren’t – x :: Either ( HeadError + LookupError ) Int y :: Either ( LookupError + HeadError ) Int\nThe values x and y are isomorphic , but we can’t use them in a do block because they’re not exactly equal. If we add errors, then we must revise all mapLeft code, as well as all case expressions that inspect the errors. Fortunately, these are entirely compiler-guided refactors, so the chance of messing them up is small. However, they contribute significant boilerplate, noise, and busywork to our program. Boilerplate be gone!\nWell, turns out, we can get rid of the order dependence and boilerplate with type classes! The most powerful approach is to use “classy prisms” from the lens package. Let’s translate our types from concrete values to prismatic ones: -- Concrete: head :: [ a ] -> Either HeadError a -- Prismatic: head :: AsHeadError err => [ a ] -> Either err a -- Concrete: lookup :: k -> Map k v -> Either LookupError v -- Prismatic: lookup :: ( AsLookupError err ) => k -> Map k v -> Either err v\nNow, type class constraints don’t care about order – (Foo a, Bar a) => a and (Bar a, Foo a) => a are exactly the same thing as far as GHC is concerned. The AsXXX type classes will automatically provide the mapLeft stuff for us, so now our foo function looks a great bit cleaner: foo :: ( AsHeadError err , AsLookupError err , AsParseError err ) => String -> Either err Integer foo str = do c <- head str r <- lookup str strMap parse ( c : r )\nThis appears to be a significant improvement over what we’ve had before! And, most of the boilerplate with the AsXXX classes is taken care of via Template Haskell: makeClassyPrisms '' P arseError -- this line generates the following: class AsParseError a where _ParseError :: Prism' a ParseError _UnexpectedChar :: Prism' a ( Char , String ) _RanOutOfInput :: Prism' a () instance AsParseError ParseError where -- etc...\nHowever, we do have to write our own boilerplate when we eventually want to concretely handle these ttypes. We may end up writing a huge AppError that all of these errors get injected into.\nThere’s one major, fatal flaw with this approach. While it composes very nicely, it doesn’t decompose at all! There’s no way to catch a single case and ensure that it’s handled. The machinery that prisms give us don’t allow us to separate out a single constraint, so we can’t pattern match on a single error.\nOnce again, our types become ever larger, with all of the problems that entails. Generics to the rescue!\nWhat we really want is: Order independence Easy composition Easy decomposition\nIn PureScript or OCaml, you can use open variant types to do this flawlessly. Haskell doesn’t have open variants, and the attempts to mock them end up quite clumsy to use in practice.\nI’m happy to say that the entire job is handled quite nicely with the amazing generic-lens package. I created a gist that demonstrates their usage, but the magic comes down to this simple fact: there’s an instance of the prismatic AsType class for Either , which allows you to “pluck” a constraint off. This satisfies all of the things I wanted in my list, and we can consider representing errors mostly solved. Mostly?\nWell, ExceptT e IO a still imposes a significant runtime performance hit, and asynchronous exceptions aren’t considered here. A bifunctor IO type like newtype BIO err a = BIO (IO a) which carries the type class constraints of the errors it contains is promising, but I haven’t been able to write a satisfying interface to this yet.\nI also haven’t used this technique in a large codebase yet, and I don’t know how it scales. And the technique does require you to be comfortable with lens , which is a fairly high bar for training new folks on. I’m sure that API improvements could be made to make this style more accessible and remove some of the lens knowledge prerequisites.\nMy blog is hosted on GitHub .

      "text": "« previous post | next post »\nHere we go again. More Roman letters and English words on police and security guard uniforms in China (see below for some earlier posts). Here's a doozy:\nI suspect that only an infinitesimal number of people on the planet would be able to figure out what \"CNFJ\" on the back of this officer's vest stands for (no, it's not \" Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Japan\") . I'm guessing that it means: Chángníng fújǐng 长宁服警 (\"Changning service police\"), or maybe the FJ is for fǔjǐng 辅 警 (\"auxiliary police\")\nChangning is the name of a district in Shanghai where this photograph was taken. It would be pronounced Zan1nyin1 in Shanghainese.\nIn the following portfolio, we see a variety of police and security guards identified solely in English or in a combination of English and Chinese. tèjǐng 特警 (\"special police\") jǐngchá 警察 (\"police\") Lónghuá jīxùn 龙华机训 (\"Longhua machine training\") — Longhua is a subdistrict of Shenzhen ; \"machine training\" refers to familiarizing the public with the use of various types of bomb detection apparatuses.\nPaul Midler remarks: We see the uniforms getting a more standard, better look, while there remains no real standardization of terminology and language usage. I think the biggest point can be made with the word SECURITY. Most people in China (Shenzhen here) don’t readily read English. Chinese understand this person is important or powerful because of the English lettering alone? Martin Jacques , in When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order , promised us that we would all be speaking Mandarin! This is hardly the case it seems. I don’t ever see the world learning Mandarin.\nTicket machines in a train station:\nFor CRH, I sort of guessed \" China Railway High-speed \".\n\"Again\", asks Paul, \"where has Martin Jacques gone? Where’s all that Middle Kingdom jingoism? China’s rise was supposed to make us all speak Mandarin! Their high-speed rail is most popularly known by three English letters—CRH?\"\nFinally, on the ubiquitousness of Roman letters and English names and words, Paul quotes the following passage (see especially the second paragraph below) from his recently published book, What's Wrong with China? :\nIn this particular regard, I don't think anything is wrong with China. I think that China has simply \"opened up\" (kāifàng 開放), as Deng Xiaoping advocated four decades ago. As we are keenly aware, attitudes towards foreign languages — English in particular — can serve as a bellwether for predicting changes toward foreign cultures and countries that may be in the offing. So long as the communist authorities do not radically and ruthlessly prohibit the use and spread of the Roman alphabet and English language — no matter what their rhetoric concerning them might be — it means that they are essentially following a policy of linguistic laissez-faire with regard to the Roman alphabet and the English language (which is not what they are doing vis-à-vis, say, Cantonese, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Mongolian).\nReadings",

David Marjanović said, November 4, 2018 @ 6:45 am\nSure. If you enter a wrong PIN three times, your card is blocked, and some machines keep it. Laura Morland said, November 4, 2018 @ 10:20 am\n\"Return, Correct, Confirm\" … they are ALL verbs!\nWhen negotiating ATMs abroad, it helps to bear in mind their usual functions, or patterns, as Dick Margulis noted above. Mike M said, November 4, 2018 @ 11:40 am\nI think I would've gotten this right – in Canada there is usually a 'Correction' button so I would've made the association. Other machines (such as my German bank) often do a poor job though. When you cancel a transfer, it asks you 'OK' or 'Cancel' – 'Cancel' here means cancel the cancellation November 5, 2018 @ 7:25 am\nLaura: \"When negotiating ATMs abroad, it helps to bear in mind their usual functions, or patterns\"\nI once (momentarily) impressed a visiting prof from China with my grasp of written Chinese whilst fixing something on his personal Mac until I had to admit that the menu items were all in their usual places. November 5, 2018 @ 9:13 am\nOn a complicated ATM in Spain I was surprised when it twice did not accept my the PIN I entered. It was only then that I noticed that the numerical keyboard was calculator-style (with 123 at the bottom) instead of telephone style (123 at the top). I thought it best cancel and find another machine, and not risk my card getting eaten. philip said, November 5, 2018 @ 10:04 am\nBecause of some language option button I pressed inadvertently, my ATM card now thinks it is Spanish. When I use it on machines at home (Ireland), it automatically goes into the Spanish option, with no option to switch languages. The first time it happened, I presumed the ATM was faulty and warned the next person in the queue that the machine was speaking Spanish. But, when he put his card in, up popped the English options.\nIt's as well I can speak Spanish. Well, enough Spanish to get my money out, anyway!",
